    <p>I'm a Junior in the iSchool at Syracuse University with a minor in Marketing. I am from Connecticut and I want to live in New York City after graduation. I am taking IST263 to learn more about designing websites and HTML.</p>
    <p>This summer I traveled with my family and interned in Stamford, Connecticut at a digital marketing platform. In my free time I like excersizing and being outside with my friends and family. </p>
